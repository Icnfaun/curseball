# Curseball
A baseball game built in c with ncurses, stat/intuition based gameplay. Absolutly nothing rn except part of the menu system

## Current Plan
1.) Create a modular menu system, and a menu maker that allows easy modding and further additions.

2.) Decide how teams, players and their data will be stored, and create a team builder that will allow importing of multiple formats of
player/team data. Main focus being easy and understandable importing of data.

3.) Develop base game starting with player inputted gameplay, and working up to pitcher and batter ai.

4.) Make it pretty.

All player data is from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/
